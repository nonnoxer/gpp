# Instructions for transferring bot

I've created a barebones setup for you to remake your bot in python; it shouldn't be too difficult as all you need to do is to follow the format in `gpp_cog.py`.

To run this bot, remember to set the TOKEN environment variable to your bot's token. To edit commands, go to `gpp_cog.py`.

To host the bot, I recommend using Heroku as it is a free python hosting site: I've already setup the requirements.txt, runtime.txt and Procfile for it to work.

If you have any questions feel free to pm me or whatever.
